        Overview
The major problem with any micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) is that it can fly in
air for a short period of time due to energy and weight constraints associated with an
electrical propulsion system. Solar powered micro UAVs that store the excess charge
for the night are an alternative solution, but with current battery technologies and their
energy is to weight ratio, the energy is just barely sufficient for slow gliding through the
night. As the batteries are heavy, a Solar powered micro UAV needs to have an
extremely efficient and robust design. With these constraints designing a solar UAV that
can have perpetual flight (theoretically) is hard, except in certain favorable conditions.
The main aim of the project is to develop a ‘Solar Endurance UAV’ The unmanned
vehicle in its finished stage will be able to sustain continuous long flights with very few
stops for maintenance. The product will maximize its efficiency by utilizing wind updrafts
to its advantage i.e. we will incorporate the concept of soaring into our product. Also, the
auxiliary batteries attached onboard will be charged during the day by solar panels
attached on the wings of the product.
It is our belief that the project can be used majorly for surveillance and can advance the
industry towards energy efficiency in a significant way. The product can also be
included in space exploration missions with minor modifications to its structure.
Geological explorations of earth can be made easier since our product will be able to
cover large areas of lands just on wind energy.
We would also be implementing a more effective and efficient MPPT (Maximum power
point tracker) algorithm, which would reduce energy loss.Technical Insight
Autopilot algorithms will be integrated into the product’s main control mechanism which
will judge the wind speed around it and decide it’s path instantaneously. It improvises
time-to-time and learns air patterns to decide the optimal path.
