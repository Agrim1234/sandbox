      1. Give a brief description about your project.
<br><br>
The arm robot will be a robot which will completely resemble the structure and movement of an actual human arm. The bot consists of the 5 fingers , a forearm and one upper arm. The bot will assist in picking and placing objects and also picking and pouring or tilting the object.The robot will be controlled remotely over WiFi so that the robot can be used in places which is not accessible properly to humans.
<br><br>
2. Who are the target customers?
<br><br>
The product has a lot of real life applications. The product can be used in warehouses to access materials which are located in places which are not properly accessible to humans.The robot can be used as a helper bot which pick and place different objects as well as used in labs where a same action has to be done for a long period of time.
<br><br>
3. What stage of development is the project in?
<br><br>
We have finished the imitation phase of the project in which we control the fingers of the arm with gestures. We are currently manufacturing the forearm and the upper arm and assembling the circuit for control the forearm and upper arm. 
<br><br>
4. What facilities do you use in sandbox?
<br><br>
We have extensively used the 3-D printer and the mechanical room for manufacturing the fingers and the palm of the armbot.
Apart from that we have used flex sensors , Arduino Uno , Xbee modules, xbee arduino sheilds.
<br><br>
5. How has sandbox helped in the progress of your projects ?
<br><br>
Sandbox has helped us in speedy manufacturing of the mechanical structure of the arm. Due to availability of the huge inventory we were able to explore many techniques to find the best fit for our ptoduct.
