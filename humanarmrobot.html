      A Human Arm Robot made by the BITSians at Sandbox resembles and works like a normal arm. It is finely equipped with all the
      fingers, forearms and upper arm and its capability are almost at par with Human Hands. It is capable of picking, placing and
      tilting objects of different shapes and dimensions. Liquids can be transferred from one container to the other with the
      help of the bot. The bot can even be expanded to be attached to a rover and conduct operations in the far-off places which
      are too dangerous or inaccessible to humans as it is controlled remotely over WiFi.The job possibilities for the bot are
      many as the bot can be used for performing actions that require precision and/or need to be repeated multiple number of
      times without stopping.

      The project has already been initialized as the students have manufactured and are able to control the fingers of the arm
      using gestures. They are currently working in the second out of two phases of the manufacturing and the controlling of
      the upper arm and forearm.
