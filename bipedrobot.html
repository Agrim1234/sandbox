       Biped Robots are what laymen would call Robotic Human Legs. These unique bots are different because they work like Human Legs
       to move around and do not depend on the wheels. These have six degrees of freedom with two in hips, knees and ankles each.
       The joints of Hips and Knees have pitching freedom which in simple words means that bot can go up and down using these
       joints. These joints can tilt to provide the robot with the stability in the plane which cuts the body in left-right and
       is known as Sagittal Plane. The rolling freedom present in the ankles helps in maintaining the balance of bot in front-
       back direction known as Frontal or Coronal Plane. These joints provide the bot with high level of stability, freedom and
       efficiency while walking. The capabilities of these bots make them great for travelling to places where neither bot with
       wheels can go nor humans.
       <br><br>
       The bot is in advanced stage of making. CAD modelling, Manufacturing of links and motors has been completed. Designing of 
       controls system is finished and the team is working on itâ€™s implementation.
