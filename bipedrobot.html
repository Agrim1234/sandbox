       	We are working on bot that can walk using legs and not wheels. The bot has 6 degrees of freedom,
	two in the hips, two in the knees and two in the ankles. The hips and knees have the pitching
	degree of freedom while the ankles have the rolling degree of freedom. The pitching degree of
	freedom is for stability in the sagittal plane while the rolling degree of freedom is for stability in
	the frontal plane. The objective is to make the bot walk with high stability and efficiency.
	The design of the bot is ready and a CAD model has been made. Work on trajectory planning has
	been done in MATLAB. Trajectory design is ready and work on walking stability has also been
	done. Work on the inverse kinematics model is currently in progress. Manufacturing of the links
	is done and manufacturing of the motor mounts is being done. Design of the control system is
	done and work on implementation is under progress. The circuit design is ready and the
	electronic purchases have been made.

	Sandbox Lab was very useful as its facilities have been very helpful in saving our time. The
	mechanical room of the lab has been the most useful because of the availability of various tools.
	The electronic components available in the lab were enough to test various circuits. Access to the
	lab at any time of the day has helped a lot. Availability of facilities at any time of the day has
	saved a lot time of the team.
	<br><br>
	From the perspective of our project, Sandbox Lab has enough facilities available.
