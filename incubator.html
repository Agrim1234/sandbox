        BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT	
	<br><br>
	Incubator is the part of NICU (Neonatal ICU). Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is an intensive care unit specializing in the care 		of ill or pre-maturely born baby. Incubator provides a controlled, closed environment for the baby, in an attempt to establish some 		womb like conditions.
	<br>  
 	The primary requirements of the controlled environment are maintaining a temperature between 32 – 37 degree Celsius and relative 		humidity of around 70-90%. Some other requirements of the incubator are a regulated oxygen supply, maintaining proper noise levels, 		carbon dioxide levels monitoring, a proper air filtering system and so on. 
	<br>
	Designing a control system that regulates temperature and humidity is the primary focus of the team. Two modes of temperature control 		have been recognized: Servo control ,that is, temperature variation depending on the baby’s skin temperature and the pre- set mode 		which regulates temperature depending on the  temperature of the environment, with a tolerance of +/- 0.5 degree Celsius. Humidity 		level tolerance +/- 10%. 
	<br>
	The model that is being built by the team is taking care of establishing temperature and humidity control , in the presence of a 		steady oxygen supply. Also the product being constructed is being made in such a manner that it complies with the ingernationally 		recognized standards for the incubator - IEC 60601-2-19 and 60601-2-20. Other additional features include the presence of an alarm 		system to draw attention in case of breakdown of system and a console for the user to input ideal temperature that has to be 		maintained.
	<br><br>
	The ultimate aim of the product is to be competent enough to be comparable with 
	<br><br>
	TARGET CUSTOMERS:
	<br><br>
	The target customers of this product are those rural and town hospitals that cannot afford the expensive incubator imported into the 		country. Thus this product is aiming to do its bit in enhancing the medication and treatment facilities in the country by making 		affordable and efficient incubators.   
	<br><br>
	STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRODUCT:
	<br><br>
	The incubator is required to maintain great accuracy in its control mechansism. Hence, a lot of effort has been directed in to 		reading up research papers and theses on the same and exploring avenues for improvement. Presently, the team is trying to build a 		model that maintains temperature and humidity levels as per the medical regulations for an incubator. A simulation model is being 		constructed, for analysis of stability of the control system under construction, for greater accuracy during building of the actual 		model. Parallely constructional features with a thermodynamic advantage for the model are being studied before the actual 		construction of the model.

 	FACILITIES USED AT SANDBOX
	<br><br>
	For testing of a basic controller circuit, various ICs available at Sandbox were used. Sensors that would act as a substitute for the 		sensors to be used in the model were used. Microcontroller like the Arduino Uno was used to generate a control signal. The 3-D 		printer was used to fashion a compartment for the circuit built. Various softwares like the Arduino IDE, ,MATLAB,SOLIDWORKS installed 		in the  computers of the Sandbox were extensively used for the project. The PCB machine ,laser cutter are of great utility for 		project in the near future.

	AID PROVIDED BY SANDBOX:
	<br><br>	
	Electronic components that are not easily available were at our disposal for testing. The various facilities as ,mentioned above have 		made working very easy. The various tools in the mechanical workshop were also of great use and will remain to be. Also the ambience 		provided in the Sandbox really helped as it allowed fo rinteraction with other project members and consult them for software use aid 		and for some ideas.
