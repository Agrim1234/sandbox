        Environmental friendly goals for mobility solutions can be achieved through several ways – modularity, electric drive-train,
        reducing development time and downtime. Universal Mobility Armoured Mobility Solution (UMAMS) blends in all the factors to
        develop an ecofriendly solution simplistic framework which has never been attempted before according to our knowledge. The
        product is completely modular, and each component can be swapped/ extended/ removed/ upgraded according to the needs
        specified by user. Presently available modular system allows for a change in external functions with definite framework but
        UMAMS allow users to change the complete framework (chassis) of the vehicle along with the external functional modules. In
        terms of analogy, we are developing a chassis which is modular, and can fit any body (big as truck, bus; small as robotic
        systems, wheelchair). The other major technological benefit apart from modularity is electric drive, which has enabled to
        make a simplistic 4-friendly mobility solution.The targeted customers are variety of fields (whose application is related
        to mobility) such as defence establishments, commercial transportation applications, disabled people mobility, security
        and research firms.

        The first prototype is under progress and will be completed by the end of the March’18. It will also be the technology
        demonstrator along with the proof of concept.
