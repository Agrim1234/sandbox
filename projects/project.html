	Re-Glove is a wearable device being developed in the Sandbox to communicate with computers,
	devices, robots and artificial environments. It is a foray into the fields of Augmented Reality and
	Virtual Reality.
	<br>
	<ul class="clist1">	
	<li>
	Traditional input devices have limited functionality which does not include the capabilities
	of interacting with the objects in computer environments. This project aims to solve this
	problem though the use of physical gestures to control a device using intuitive, natural
	movements.
	</li>
	<li>
	The communication can take place both wirelessly and in a wired manner.
	</li>
	<li>
	The glove potentially offers limitless application as it can be used to drive vehicles, control
	office and home electronics, media playback, robots in manufacturing lines and ultimately it
	can even act as an universal controller.
	</li>
	<li>
	Testers who were engaged with the glove informed that the glove offered more natural and
	intuitive control than the project had initially aimed.

	The tiny device can be attached to luggage, laptops and other costly personal belongings to
	alert the owner of any unwanted movement with the help of flashing lights, buzzers or an
	SMS to the owner's smartphone.

	<li>
	It can even be attached to hotel doors if the owner is worried about anyone entering the
	room with duplicate keys. If an unauthorised person tries to open the door, an alarm will be
	set off, alerting one to the case of a possible intrusion.

	<li>
	The prototype has already been developed and the team is now working on reducing its size
	more and making it more energy-efficient.
	</li>
	<li>
	The ubiquitous nature of the device helps the team to target a very large consumer base,
	inclusive of but not limited to the tourism and travel industry, security companies, property
	owners etc. Its main utility lies in the fact that it is cost-effective, convenient to use and that
	it would alarm the owner about any attempt at theft of belongings or unwanted intrusion in
	his/her vicinity, enabling him/her to take proper action.

	intelligence to perform tasks in new environments.
	<br>
	<ul class="clist6">
	<li>
	The project addresses the functional limitations of current robots which are either
	autonomous or are controlled by specific instruction sets to perform selected tasks.

	<li>
	It completely removes the fear of Robotic AI from people's mind.
	</li>
	<li>
	The project has universal application because of the reach of AI and computers in almost all
	fields. Organizations that need to access hazardous, fatal or commercially unviable areas for
	humans are probable buyers of the Humanoid. Government Municipalities, Fire and Traffic
	departments are current target customers and in the long run the humanoid aims to serve in
	defence agencies.

	<li>
	The first prototype which served as a proof of the concept was completed in December
	2017. The second and final prototype was completed by the end of June'18. Quoting the
	team members, "Without the Sandbox, we wouldn't have been able to come so far in so little
	time, from where we started in the journey of our project." The team also pitched their idea

	The project aims to make a two-part wearable electronic gadget encompassed in a belt and
	wristband. The objective is to equip the visually impaired with basic object detection capabilities
	ans ease in making phone calls.
        <ul class="clist11">
	<li>
	The project plan involves designing the product and equipping it with features like panic
	buttons, object detection and AI. The team is currently working on the design of the belt
	sensors.
	</li>
	<li>
	The product has a specific customer target base - the visually impaired - those with inherent
	lack of eyesight and those who suffered vision loss later in life.
	</li>
	<li>
	Catering to both these sets of consumers is precisely why the product employs use of braille
	sequences as well as different languages speech recognition and English inputs with the
	help of keys.

	<ul class="clist12">
	<li>
	These modules can link to each other, locomote individually or in clusters, move relative to
	each other, and communicate with each other to form a variety of robots in single or
	multiple tasks.
	</li>
	<li>
	The team is trying to achieve three baisc features, namely, Locomotion, Linkage and
	Movement for which the modules must be able to sense relative positions with respect to
	each other.

	<li>
	The Modular Robots will have a variety of applications in geological surveys and data
	collection, geographical exploration and have several other civil, commercial and military
