      <button class="accordion1">What is Sandbox? Is it just a workspace or do we get a certificate or some credit?
      </button>
      <div class="panel1">
        <p>Sandbox is an incubation centre for the projects, so, your work is your certificate. There are no
	academic credits awarded for the projects, but students in the past have gone on to do projects
	under faculty members after learning from their experience in the Sandbox.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion2">I have a project that I want to work on in the Sandbox. What is the procedure for it?
      </button>
      <div class="panel2">
        <p>The Sandbox team calls for projects at the start of every semester. Students are expected to
	explain their idea. Shortlisted students are then called for a Faculty Interview. Ideas which seem
	feasible and require mostly the facilities available in Sandbox are then selected.  
        </p>

      <button class="accordion6">How are the projects funded?
      </button>
      <div class="panel6">

	monetary funding as of now.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion7">How do you get access to the Sandbox?

      <div class="panel7">

	the Sandbox.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion10">What do you mean by a Sandbox project? How is it different from any other project?
