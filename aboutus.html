      <button class="accordion1">How does the Sandbox benefit the students?
      </button>
      <div class="panel1">
        <p>Sandbox facilitates them in pursuing their projects. It provides them with equipments and tools which they wouldn't have
          been able to afford on their own otherwise, at zero cost. The Sandbox is like an incubator which aids students in
          transforming their ideas into reality.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion2">How did the concept of Sandbox evolve and how was it esatblished?
      </button>
      <div class="panel2">
        <p>The concept of Sandbox is similar to that of MakerSpaces coming up all around the world. BITS Pilani University had a
          special budget to build a Makerspace for the Goa campus.  The Hyderabad campus already had a Sandbox, and students in
          the Goa campus were also asking for a lab space with facilities to develop products.
          <br><br>
          The idea was realised after a huge effort by our previous director, Dr. Sasikumar Punnekkat and some seniors of student
          -run technical clubs like ERC (Electronics and Robotics) and AeroD (Aerodynamics). Dr Punnekkat provided a grant he'd
          received for the initial setup and facilities before leaving and thus was realised the idea of a lab with expensive
          equipments which could be used by students for their projects.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion3">How does the Sandbox help supplement the academic curriculum that is being followed in our campus?
      </button>
      <div class="panel3">
        <p>As of now, most of the student only have bookish knowledge. The important thing to realise is that in the real world, it
          is important to know how something is done theoretically well as practically. Both of these things complement each other.
          The faculty already put in efforts by conducting regular labs based on classroom teaching but the learning faces time
          and space constraints. This is why technical clubs and Sandbox are important. The only way a project will be successful
          in these places is if the student learns how to practically implement what he/she would have learnt in the classroom.
          The extra research involved also provide an in-depth understanding of the topics.
          <br><br>
          Course projects also benefit from these. Things learnt by the students in the Sandbox projects were implemented in
          academic projects also.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion4">To be able to work inside the Sandbox, the students must first go through a competitive selection
        process. Can you tell us more about the selection process and about what the judges look for?
      </button>
      <div class="panel4">
        <p>A complete proposal indicating deliverables, timeline, required equipments etc is submitted as the first step. The
          faculty committee then selects from amongst these a few to give a presentation on their proposal. On the advice of the
          faculty committee and the Student Committe Coordinator, the selections are made and signed off on by the Director.
          The main points the committee looks for are novelty and commercializability.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion5">What role does the faculty play in the running of the Sandbox?
      </button>
      <div class="panel5">
        <p>The faculty-in-charge of Sandbox is the signing authority on the day-to-day activities/ maintenance and purchasing of
          equipment for the Sandbox. There is a separate faculty committee in-charge of the selection and evalutaion of projects.
          However, the daily operations, list of equipments needed etc. are done by the student coordination committee. The
          faculty wants the lab to be run by students who would handle the day-to-day operations while the faculty are to be
          involved as coordinators.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion6">How does the Sandbox set us apart from other colleges and universities in India?
      </button>
      <div class="panel6">
        <p>Though Sandbox is still in its early stages, we are able to provide the students will excellent facilities that they
          have used to their advantage. Students in our campus can now get free access to equipment that others only dream of.
          The experience gained by the students working in Sandbox has also helped them a lot as is evident by 3 students going
          for their thesis in Portugal, 1 in USA, 1 in Singapore, 1 for a summer internship in Amazon and another in Navstik
          Labs and many more.
          <br><br>
          Similar to the fact that a healthy mind lives in a healtyh body, having a facility like Sandbox helps one to do better
          research and development. We still have a long way to go and we only hope to be comparable if not better to other
          fablabs in developed countries.
