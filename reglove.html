        Traditional Input devices are unable to keep up with the advancements of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality because of
        their limited functionality which does not include the capabilities of interacting with the objects in the computer
        environments. The Re-glove developed in Sandbox aims to solve this problem by use of Physical gestures to control a
        device using intuitive, natural movements. These wearable devices can be used to communicate with computers, devices,
        robots and artificial environments, both wirelessly and in a wired manner. The glove potentially offers limitless
        application as it can be used to drive vehicles, control office and home electronics, media playback, robots in manufacturing
        lines and ultimately it can even act as an universal controller.

        Currently, the prototype must be tethered to a power source, communicates through line-of-sight over radio frequencies, and
        uses an MPU 6050 to collect acceleration and angular velocity readings.
