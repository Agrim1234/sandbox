    <button class="accordion1">How do you think collaboration with companies help improve the technical culture of our
      campus?
    </button>
    <div class="panel1">
      <p>A collaboration will be beneficial to all the parties involved. The company will get bright technical assistance at a very
        low cost, the students will get the experience and training from working on real world projects, and everyone will get more
        publicity. The ideas from industry are more practical and students and companies can collaborate on solutions and products
        - the companies willing to sponsor some devices given specific requirements can collaborate with the students who can work
        on those particular requirements.
      </p>

    <button class="accordion2">How does the Sandbox set us apart from other colleges and universities in India?
    </button>
    <div class="panel2">
      <p>Though Sandbox is still in its early stages, we are able to provide the students will excellent facilities that they have
        used to their advantage. Students in our campus can now get free access to equipment that others only dream of. The
        experience gained by the students working in Sandbox has also helped them a lot as is evident by 3 students going for
        their thesis in Portugal, 1 in USA, 1 in Singapore, 1 for a summer internship in Amazon and another in Navstik Labs and
        many more.
        <br><br>
        Similar to the fact that a healthy mind lives in a healtyh body, having a facility like Sandbox helps one to do better
        research and development. We still have a long way to go and we only hope to be comparable if not better to other fablabs
        in developed countries.
