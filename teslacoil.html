     	Not a lot of people know what exactly is a tesla coil and how it works. Basically, it’s a device that is exciting and educative at 		the same time. Keeping that in mind, I proposed this very project. 
	<br>
	Well, as everything to be sold requires target customers, we also have a target group in mind.. The better part here is that our 		target audience is pretty general. As mentioned earlier, this project is an educational and entertainment device in one. So, our 		target group includes 5yr olds who will get excited by this device. It also includes high school and college students who are 		interested in learning and innovating existing techniques and technology. It also includes individuals  who are in their midlife and 		are excited about new innovations. So with this huge target group in mind, we want to launch our product in the market.
	<br>
	Regarding our current progress, we have been able to make a basic slayer exciter circuit and successfully tried and tested it In 		labs. We are currently working on the manufacture of a single coil musical tesla coil. The designs for the same have been made. The 		last stage includes a larger setup with a much larger power output and more coils to create proper music with vocals and bass.

	Sandbox has helped a lot in the progress of my project. A proper work space,  a boatload of equipment, competent people who are 	working on their unique idea, this all adds up into a complete package and increases work efficiency. And I’m sure this help will 	only increase as I move onto the last stages of this project.
	And although sandbox in itself is an wesome facility, it would be very helpful to have a a relatively larger 3D scanner, so as to 	scan bigger part parts.
	<br>
With that I would like to extend our gratitude on behalf of our team.
