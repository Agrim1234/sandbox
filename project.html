          <p class="cmid1">Traditional Input devices are unable to
            keep up with the advancements of Augmented Reality and
            Virtual Reality because of their limited functionality
            which does not include the capabilities of interacting
            with the objects in the computer environments. The
            Re-glove developed in Sandbox aims to solve this problem
            by use of Physical gestures to control a device using
            intuitive, natural movements. These wearable devices can
            be used to communicate with computers, devices, robots
            and artificial environments, both wirelessly and in a
            wired manner. The glove potentially offers limitless
            application as it can be used to drive vehicles, control office
            and home electronics, media playback, robots in manufacturing
            lines and ultimately it can even act as an universal controller.
            <br><br>
            Currently, the prototype must be tethered to a power
            source, communicates through line-of-sight over radio
            frequencies, and uses an MPU 6050 to collect acceleration
            and angular velocity readings.

          <p class="cmid2">Environmental friendly goals for mobility
            solutions can be achieved through several ways - modularity
            , electric drive-train, reducing development time and
            downtime. Universal Mobility Armoured Mobility Solution
            (UMAMS) blends in all the factors to develop an
            ecofriendly solution simplistic framework which has never
            been attempted before according to our knowledge. The
            product is completely modular, and each component can be
            swapped/ extended/ removed/ upgraded according to the needs
            specified by user. Presently available modular system allows
            for a change in external functions with definite framework
            but UMAMS allow users to change the complete framework
            (chassis) of the vehicle along with the external functional
            modules. In terms of analogy, we are developing a chassis
            which is modular, and can fit any body (big as truck, bus;
            small as robotic systems, wheelchair). The other major
            technological benefit apart from modularity is electric
            drive, which has enabled to make a simplistic 4-friendly
            mobility solution.The targeted customers are variety of
            fields (whose application is related to mobility) such
            as defence establishments, commercial transportation
            applications, disabled people mobility, security and
            research firms.
            <br><br>
            The first prototype is under progress and will be
            completed by the end of the March&apos;18. It will also be the
            technology demonstrator along with the proof of concept.

            big task for travellers. They must be very alert while

            This really reduces the joy of their vacation. Therefore,
            a security gadget, BIT Secure, which would alarm the
            owner about any attempt of theft of belongings or unwanted
            intrusion in his/her vicinity is being developed in the
            Sandbox.The tiny matchbox-sized gadget, BIT Secure can
            be attached to the luggage, laptop, costly personal
            belongings or even the door of the hotels to alert the
            owner of any unwanted movement by either flashing lights,
            buzzer or a SMS too to the ownerâ€™s Smartphone.Apart from
            protecting the luggage, BIT Secure can also give peace
            of mind when one is inside a hotel room but worried about
            anyone entering the room with duplicate keys. BIT Secure can
            be attached to Hotel door from inside. Whenever intruders
            will try to open the door the alarm will set off to make
            one alert.

            A Human Arm Robot made by the BITSians at Sandbox resembles

            all the fingers, forearms and upper arm and its capability
            are almost at par with Human Hands. It is capable of
            picking, placing and tilting objects of different shapes
            and dimensions. Liquids can be transferred from one
            container to the other with the help of the bot. The
            bot can even be expanded to be attached to a rover
            and conduct operations in the far-off places which are
            too dangerous or inaccessible to humans as it is
            controlled remotely over WiFi.The job possibilities for
            the bot are many as the bot can be used for performing
            actions that require precision and/or need to be repeated
            multiple number of times without stopping.

            The project has already been initialized as the students

            Imitato Robotics are building Humanoid Robots which can
            be controlled by humans wearing an exo-suit. These robots
            target at the weakness of the current robots which are
            limited in functionality because they are either
            autonomous or are controlled by specific instruction
            sets to perform selected tasks. Imitato Robotics is
            trying to solve this problem by designing humanoids
            which mimic the actions of the humans and can use human
            intelligence to perform tasks in the new environment.
            This form of control completely removes the fear of
            Robotic AI from peopleâ€™s mind.All the organizations
            that need to access hazardous, fatal or commercially
            unviable areas for the humans are probable buyers of
            the Humanoid. Government Municipalities, Fire and traffic
            departments are current target customers but in the long
            run the humanoid aims to serve in the defense agencies.

            First prototype which served as a proof of the concept
            was completed in December 2017. Second Prototype is

	The main aim of the project is to develop a &apos;Solar Endurance UAV&apos; which will sustain continuous
	long flights with very few stops for maintenance, which is very difficult to do due to energy and
	weight constraints.
        <ul class="clist4">
	<li>
	The product will maximize its efficiency by utilizing wind updrafts to its advantage, i.e, use
	soaring.
	</li>
	<li>
	Geological explorations of earth can be made easier since the product can cover large areas
	of lands only on wind energy.
	</li>
	<li>
	Th product has a plethora of civil, commercial and military applications. Some of these
	include mobile surveillance and mapping, weather analysis, aerial photography and	
	videography, rescue missions, pick-up and delivery services over long distances, mineral
	exploration, meteorological and archaeological research.
	</li>
	<li>
	The product is currently in pre-testing phase. Tests are being carries out and the optimum
	design will be be finally used for the UAV.

	The project aims to make a two-part wearable electronic gadgetencompassed in a belt and
	wristband. The objective is to equip the visually impaired with basic object detection capabilities
	ans ease in making phone calls.
        <ul class="clist5">
	<li>
	The project plan involves designing the product and equipping it with features like panic
	buttons, object detection and AI. The team is currently working on the design of the belt
	sensors.
	</li>
	<li>
	The product has a specific customer target base - the visually impaired â€“ those with inherent
	lack of eyesight and those who suffered vision loss later in life.
	</li>
	<li>
	Catering to both these sets of consumers is precisely why the product employs use of braille
	sequences as well as different languages speech recognition and English inputs with the
	help of keys.

	These modules can link to each other, locomote individually or in clusters, move relative to

	The team is trying to achieve three baisc features, namely, Locomotion, Linkage and
