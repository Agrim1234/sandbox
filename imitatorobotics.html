        Imitato Robotics are building Humanoid Robots which can be controlled by humans wearing an exo-suit. These robots target at
        the weakness of the current robots which are limited in functionality because they are either autonomous or are controlled
        by specific instruction sets to perform selected tasks. Imitato Robotics is trying to solve this problem by designing
        humanoids which mimic the actions of the humans and can use human intelligence to perform tasks in the new environment.
        This form of control completely removes the fear of Robotic AI from people’s mind.All the organizations that need to access
        hazardous, fatal or commercially unviable areas for the humans are probable buyers of the Humanoid. Government Municipalities,
        Fire and traffic departments are current target customers but in the long run the humanoid aims to serve in the defense
        agencies
        <br><br>
        First prototype which served as a proof of the concept was completed in December 2017. Second Prototype is already designed 
        and is under development which will be finished by the end of the June’18
