        Reconfigurable robots made of small modules which
	may have common or distinct functionality based on
	the application. These modules can link to each other,
	locomote individually or in clusters, move relative to
	each other, and communicate to each other to form a
	variety of robots in a single or multiple tasks.
	<br><br>
	• What we are trying to achieve here is basically
	three basic features in our modbot:
	<br><br>
	1. Locomotion : 3 face discs and actuators(3 stepper
	motors)
	<br>
	2. Linkage : same face discs and actuators(6
	electromagnetic solenoid pistons)
	<br>
	3. Movement (DOF) : same face discs and actuators
	(same 3 stepper motors & 3 servo motors)
	For this we would need the modules to sense their
	relative position of each other for which we are using
	(MPU9255) other than that we need module to be
	controlled logically for which there would be a
	microcontroller(TEENSY 3.6) and for transfer of data
	among the modules we would need a wireless
	communication device(XBEE).
	<br><br>
	The whole module system is split into three types of
	modules:
	<br>
	1. M-module(mechanical)
	<br>
	2. E-module(electronic)
	<br>	
	3. S-module(special).
	<br><br>
	A single M-module, mechanical and electrical designs
	are completed and tested. The designs can be looked
	up at our github repository:
	https://github.com/usarawgi911/ModBots .
	The designs we have come up with are hard to achieve
	in real life using ordinary techniques, the whole body
	of our modules are completely printed using the 3-D
	printer provided to us in Sand box, we have also used
	the DC voltage supplies over there to select an
	optimistic battery for a single module, we have been
	using the PCB milling machine to make our PCB’s, tools
	in the workshop and even other inventory are used in
	the process.
	<br><br>
	The sandbox committee has helped us by giving us the
	necessary equipment and taught us how to use them,
	they also helped us by funding us to get the necessary
	sensors and actuators.
	<br><br>
	It would be nice if we had equipment which can help
	us measure the torque of our actuators and if the
	equipment in the inventory include more Xbee
	modules, Teensy boards, better IMU sensors more
	precision PCB etching machines.
