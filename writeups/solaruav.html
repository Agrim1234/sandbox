	Overview
	<br><br>
	The major problem with any micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) is that it can fly in
	air for a short period of time due to energy and weight constraints associated with an
	electrical propulsion system. Solar powered micro UAVs that store the excess charge
	for the night are an alternative solution, but with current battery technologies and their
	energy is to weight ratio, the energy is just barely sufficient for slow gliding through the
	night. As the batteries are heavy, a Solar powered micro UAV needs to have an
	extremely efficient and robust design. With these constraints designing a solar UAV that
	can have perpetual flight (theoretically) is hard, except in certain favorable conditions.
	The main aim of the project is to develop a ‘Solar Endurance UAV’ The unmanned
	vehicle in its finished stage will be able to sustain continuous long flights with very few
	stops for maintenance. The product will maximize its efficiency by utilizing wind updrafts
	to its advantage i.e. we will incorporate the concept of soaring into our product. Also, the
	auxiliary batteries attached onboard will be charged during the day by solar panels
	attached on the wings of the product.
	<br><br>
	It is our belief that the project can be used majorly for surveillance and can advance the
	industry towards energy efficiency in a significant way. The product can also be
	included in space exploration missions with minor modifications to its structure.
	Geological explorations of earth can be made easier since our product will be able to
	cover large areas of lands just on wind energy.
	<br><br>
	We would also be implementing a more effective and efficient MPPT (Maximum power
	point tracker) algorithm, which would reduce energy loss.
	<br><br>
	Technical Insight
	<br><br>
	Autopilot algorithms will be integrated into the product’s main control mechanism which
	will judge the wind speed around it and decide it’s path instantaneously. It improvises
	time-to-time and learns air patterns to decide the optimal path.
	<br><br>
	During take-off and landing precise control is required to ensure smooth transition to
	auto-pilot.
	Once safe take-off is ensured the auto-pilot takes over and starts analyzing wind
	patterns and stores data over time. This is used to map an optimal path of flight.	
	<br><br>
	Design:
	<br><br>
	The design of the product will consist of two major parts, Wing and Body.
	The wing will be designed similar to a soarer and will be made so that it can maximize
	use of winds and have a stable flight. An effort will be made to increase surface area of
	wings as much as possible to provide room for solar panels.
	The body of the aircraft will be spacious as it will be accommodating significant amount
	of the electronics and the batteries.
	<br><br>
	Electronics:
	<br><br>
	The electronics will majorly involve a processing board for the auto-pilot algorithm and a
	power control for the input from the solar panels.
	Solar panels give an output depending on the intensity of sunlight hence such
	inconsistent energy input can damage the batteries. This will be managed by attaching
	a MPPT in between the solar panels and the batteries.
	<br><br>
	Target Customers
	<br><br>
		Our product, Solar-Powered endurance UAV, can have a plethora of civil, commercial
	and military application. Some of these include mobile surveillance and mapping,
	weather analysis, aerial photography and videography, rescue missions, pick-up and
	delivery services over long distances, mineral exploration, meteorological and
	archaeological research.
	<br><br>
	Present stage of Development
	<br><br>
	The project is currently in pre-testing phase. We are preparing a prototype to collect test
	data on various parameters related to energy output of the solar panels. The data will
	be used to find the number of solar panels for a feasible output to charge the batteries.
	It will be used to find the correct combination of motor and batteries to used in the
	aircraft.
	<br><br>
	On completion of the testing designs will be developed for the aircraft. These designs
	will be constructed using different materials and the most optimum wing design will be
	used for the first model of the aircraft.
	<br><br>
	Facilities we use in sandbox
	<br><br>
	We currently use the 3-D printer and the laser cutter in Sandbox. Also, most of the
	electronics components including the auto-pilot module and the processing board for
	the auto-pilot algorithm are provided by Sandbox.
	Sandbox has provided us with miscellaneous components like motors and batteries
	during the present phase of the project
	We also have access to sophisticated tools and machinery which has reduced the time
	required for manufacturing different components of the product.
	<br><br>
	How has Sandbox helped us
	<br><br>
	The lab itself has provided a positive working environment which has acted as a catalyst
	for the project.
	A presence of proper equipment along with the experience from other projects in the lab
	has helped the project progress smoothly over time.
	<br><br>
	Facilities which should be added to Sandbox
	<br><br>
	Sandbox lacks in materials processing equipment significantly. Machinery for
	processing carbon fiber and other such strong materials should be added to the lab.
	The presence of a wind tunnel would help out project significantly and will be a valuable
	addition to Sandbox.
