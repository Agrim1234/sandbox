        1. Give a brief description about your project.
<br><br>
Environmental friendly goals for mobility solutions can be achieved through several ways –
modularity, electric drive-train, reducing development time and downtime. Universal
Mobility Armoured Mobility Solution (UMAMS) blends in all the factors to develop an eco-
friendly solution simplistic framework which has never been attempted before according to
our knowledge. The defining concept of the system is modularity. Each and every
component that is present in the system can be swapped/ extended/ removed/ upgraded
according to the needs specified by user. Current systems that are developed on the
principle of modularity mostly allow, users to swap the external functional components with
a definite framework (chassis). UMAMS however allow users to change the complete
framework (chassis) of the vehicle and also the external functional modules. The closest
analogy to our system is Body-on-Wheel chassis where chassis represents the framework
we are developing and body represents the external functional module and the common
connection between the chassis and body is functional bay. In terms of analogy, we are
developing a chassis which is modular, and can fit any body (big as truck, bus; small as
robotic systems, wheelchair).The other major technological benefit apart from modularity is
electric drive, which has enabled us to make a simplistic 4-friendly mobility solution.
<br><br>
2. Who are the target customers?
<br><br>
We are targeting customers in variety of fields (whose application is related to mobility)
such as defence establishments, commercial transportation applications, disabled people
mobility, security and research firms.
<br><br>
The closest analogy to our system is Body-on-Wheel chassis where chassis represents the
framework we are developing and body represents the external functional module and the
common connection between the chassis and body is functional bay. Hence , there is an
endless possibility and market available.
<br><br>
3. What stage of development is the project in?
<br><br>
We are developing the first prototype of our product and hope to complete it by the end of
March, 2018. It will also be the technology demonstrator along with the proof of concept.
We have already established the internal communication between modules via CAN Bus and
microcontrollers and are working on wireless control of the framework along with the
hardware manufacturing.
<br><br>
4. What facilities do you use in sandbox?
<br><br>
As the requirements of our design are wide, the facilities required are also very vast and
Sandbox has provided us with many of those facilities. We have extensively used 3 D
printers for manufacturing of the wheel assembly. Also the workshop equipments provided
in the Sandbox has enabled us to manufacture the prototype in the same place as the setup
of electronics speeding up our progress. We have used the electronics and general inventory
provided by sandbox to a great extent for our requirements.
<br><br>
5. How has sandbox helped in the progress of your projects ?
<br><br>
The environment of work is very essential for the effectiveness of work, and Sandbox has
taken up the bar for an inclusive, “chilled” (an AC workshop – how cool is that) and
accommodative environment very well suited for working with peace of mind and anytime
according to our preferences. Also, sandbox provides us with a place to discuss on the
further steps of the project with the whole team.
<br><br>
6. What other facilities would you like having in sandbox ?
<br><br>
The other facilities I would like to have is one 5 axis CNC, better ventilation in workshop (for
fumes for wood and metal working to escape easily), CAD and CAM softwares in the
computers provided (for wholistic development of prototypes), ease of material
procurement and also fast procurement of consumables, 2.4 GHz transmitters.
Any more facilities added will help us in achieving our goals better.
