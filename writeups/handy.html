        1.Brief Description about the Project-
	<br>
	The aim of our project is to make a two part wearable electronic gadget consisting of a Belt and Wristband which allows the blind to 		make phone calls with ease and also provides a basic object detection capability to visually impaired people.It basically has three 		main features.
	First will be to give blinds access to below mentioned 5 features when there is no internet connectivity. 
	<br><br>
	First - Enabling the product with call and speed dial In the first phase our prime focus will be to give blind people access to below 		mentioned 5 features when there is no internet connectivity. 
	<br><br>
	1.Enabling the product with call and speed dial feature.
	<br>
	2.Make it play songs and audio books with a click.
	<br>
	3.Make it send audio message.
	<br>
	4.home button which will enable ok google and set day ,date and time.	
	<br>
	5. Panic button which will send message to 5 relatives lid works to design the it.
	Second  - we will work on object detection and guiding them to object free path by giving direction like left, right, forward.
	 Third - we will enable blind with the power of Artificial Intelligence(AI) giving them access to news,knowledge,music via speech 		recognition techniques.It will also enable them to make calls and send text messages.
	<br><br>
	2. Who are the target customers?
	<br><br>
	Our target is not only the people who were born without proper eyesight, but also those who lost their sight as they grew, due to 		various reasons. That is why our product is not solely made of braille sequences, but also employs different language speech 		recognition and English inputs with the help of keys.
	<br><br>
	3. What stage of development is the project in?
	<br><br>
	Good amount of research, for design and product development, has been carried out and currently, we have started working on the 	sensors for the belt.
	<br><br>
	4. The facilities we use of the sandbox are Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Solder gun and solder, Multimeters and Power Supplies and we 	intend to use the 3D printer and PCB printing facilities as well.
	<br><br>
	5. Sandbox has helped in many ways, the facility acts as a good meeting point and seeing enthusiastic individuals motivates us to 		work harder. The sandbox also provided us with an opportunity to pursue our projects providing a platform which would have been near 		impossible to obtain otherwise.
	<br><br>
	6. Other facilities you would like to have at sandbox?
	<br><br>
	All the facilities that we require for the completion of this project are already available in sandbox.
