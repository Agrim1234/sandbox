      Safety and security of personal belongings such as luggage, purses containing valuables etc. is a big task for travellers.
      They must be very alert while staying at places, hotels which lack extra security. This really reduces the joy of their
      vacation. Therefore, a security gadget, BIT Secure, which would alarm the owner about any attempt of theft of belongings
      or unwanted intrusion in his/her vicinity is being developed in the Sandbox.The tiny matchbox-sized gadget, BIT Secure
      can be attached to the luggage, laptop, costly personal belongings or even the door of the hotels to alert the owner
      of any unwanted movement by either flashing lights, buzzer or a SMS too to the ownerâ€™s Smartphone.Apart from protecting
      the luggage, BIT Secure can also give peace of mind when one is inside a hotel room but worried about anyone entering
      the room with duplicate keys. BIT Secure can be attached to Hotel door from inside. Whenever intruders will try to
      open the door the alarm will set off to make one alert.
